# HSLQ

This project was made as part of the 2017 Scientific Initiation Scholarship Program provided by FAPESB (Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado da Bahia) and UESC (Universidade Estadual de Santa Cruz) to the student Adriano Passos under the tutoring of Dr. César Alberto Bravo Pariente.

### Prerequisites

This is a Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 project targeting .NET Framework 4.0, so you'll need the following:

```
Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 or superior (to open the project)
.NET Framework 4.0 or superior (to run the application)
```

### Usage

Just load one or multiple image files (*.jpg, *.jpeg, *.png, *.bmp) to reduce the number of colors in the images to 64. You can select "Tools > HSL Quantizer" to change the number of colors and also set the option to apply dithering to the final image.
